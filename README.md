Chrome Extension

It's my first chrome extension based on React (Ts) SPA. There are 3 blocks: 
1) Current time and date (using enough bright colour). It is convinient to use as timer for whatever reason or just as a clock
2) Pocket block for saving useful links. Living period is before next page reload
3) Quotes block. Motivational quotes for a day. Change every 30 sec. At times i need to see it for motivation to following my goals

Technologies:
  - React
  - Typescript
  - API
  - manifest 3
